Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and1 their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail, and1 Peter. 

They lived1 with1 their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree. 

"Now my dears," said old Mrs. Rabbit1 one1 morning, "you may go into1 the fields or down the lane, but don't go into1 Mr. McGregor's garden: your1 Father had an1 accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor."

"Now run along, and1 don't get1 into1 mischief. I am1 going1 out." Then old Mrs. Rabbit2 took a basket and1 her umbrella2, and1 went through the wood to1 the baker's.

She bought2 a loaf of brown bread and1 five currant buns.

Flopsy, Mopsy, and1 Cottontail, who were good1 little bunnies, went down the lane to1 gather blackberries: But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to1 Mr. McGregor's garden, and1 squeezed under the gate!

First he ate some letusses and1 some French beans; and1 then he ate some radishes; And1 then, feeling rather1 sick, he went to1 look for1 some parsley. But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!




in a cavern, in a canyon, excavating for1 a mine, dwelt a miner, forty-niner, and1 his daughter Clementine1.

With1 glowing hearts, we see thee rise, the true north strong and1 free!

There is not in this wide world a valley so sweet, as that1 vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet.
