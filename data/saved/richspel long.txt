In1 a cavern, in1 a canyon, excavating for1 a mine, dwelt a miner, forty-niner, and1 his1 daughter Clementine1.

A north country maid down to1 London had strayed, although with1 her nature it1 did1 not agree.

With1 glowing hearts, we see thee rise, the1 true north strong and1 free!

Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong under the1 shade of1 a coolibah tree. 

There is1 not in1 this1 wide world a valley so sweet, as1 that1 vale in1 whose bosom the1 bright waters meet.

I refuse3 to1 join any club that1 would have me as1 a member.

No man has1 a good1 enough1 memory to1 be1 a successful liar.
